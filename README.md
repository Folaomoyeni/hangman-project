# hangman Project - Ai Core
AiCore hangman project
So here's the thing - I initially had no clue how to code in Python and my R knowledge was very rusty from my uni days. I do recall the stress of finding where I needed to add a semi colon or remove a full stop lol.
But starting on Ai Core and using Solo Learn for the moments my 8 month old won't let me sit at my desktop, gave me a chance to learn Python from scratch, so here I present my first project; Hangman.

It started with setting up my workspace and getting familiar with Visual Code, the terminal and re-aquainting myself with using a mac (I'm a Windows/Android lady!). 
I went through some modules on Ai Core - particularly how to apply my skills that I learned on Solo Learn more.

With the docutext, I mapped out which skills I would need and played about each day to see if they would gove the right output. 

And here we are - with searching, many iterations and moments of joy (as well as the crying little guy who did not care I'm in the middle of a career/identity crisis) Hangman was complete.

Have fun with it if you'd like to try it out!
